# ex00: Start with a few functions
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, whatever.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions :None

Implement the following function templates:
- swap: Swaps the values of two given parameters. Does not return anything.
- min: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the smallest one.
    If they are equal, it returns the second one.
- max: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the greatest one.
    If they are equal, it returns the second one.

These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is
that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison
operators.

Templates must be defined in the header files.

Running the following code:

int main( void ) {
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
::swap( a, b );
std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( a, b ) = " << ::min( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( a, b ) = " << ::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
std::string c = "chaine1";
std::string d = "chaine2";
::swap(c, d);
std::cout << "c = " << c << ", d = " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "min( c, d ) = " << ::min( c, d ) << std::endl;
std::cout << "max( c, d ) = " << ::max( c, d ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}

Should output:

a = 3, b = 2
min(a, b) = 2
max(a, b) = 3
c = chaine2, d = chaine
min(c, d) = chaine
max(c, d) = chaine
