# ex02: Array
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Array.{h, hpp}
and optional file: Array.tpp
Forbidden functions :None

Develop a class template **Array** that contains elements of typeTand that implements
the following behavior and functions:

- Construction with no parameter: Creates an empty array.
- Construction with an unsigned intnas a parameter: Creates an array ofnelements
    initialized by default.
    Tip: Try to compileint * a = new int();then display*a.
- Construction by copy and assignment operator. In both cases, modifying either the
    original array or its copy after copying musnâ€™t affect the other array.
- You MUST use the operatornew[]to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (al-
    locating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non-
    allocated memory.
- Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: [ ].
- When accessing an element with the [ ] operator, if its index is out of bounds, an
    std::exceptionis thrown.
- A member functionsize()that returns the number of elements in the array. This
    member function takes no parameters and must not modify the current instance.

As usual, ensure everything works as expected and turn in amain.cppfile that con-
tains your tests.
